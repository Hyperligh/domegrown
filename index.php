								<h1><span>Welcome to Dome Grown Produce</span></h1>
								
							<p>
							In 2010, my husband and I purchased our first greenhouse and this was when Dome Grown Produce was born.  It’s a 26’ geodesic dome kit that utilizes passive solar technology and unique undersoil heating tubes in raised beds. This helps us grow vegetables year round.   We disassembled and moved the dome to our new 20 acre farm in the summer of 2013, where we continue growing today.  Moving in the summer, pregnant with our son Emmett, and expanding a tiny business all at the same was a little hectic. We built another hoop-house, a big chicken run, and planted an orchard. This spring we are starting our first official CSA. We continue to clean up the property which had been neglected and overgrazed.  We will continue to fight the weeds that pop up everywhere.  We will continue to be stewards of our property the way I learned back in school.  We will also continue to produce good organic food and protect the land that we grow it on.
							After all this time I have finally made it back to my roots.
