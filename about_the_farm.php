								<h1><span>About Dome Grown Produce</span></h1>
								

							<p>It all started way back when I was just a little girl, and I grew up on a farm in Upstate New York.  Some of my first childhood memories are of the garden and helping my dad in it.  Well, I don’t know how much help I really was…  I distinctly remember helping plant corn and beans, because the seeds were large and easy to handle.  I also helped eat a lot of vegetables right off the plants.  My mom would always find me out in the garden with a mouthful of cherry tomatoes.  I think that growing up on the farm instilled in me the value of fresh, safe food.

										<h2>Eager to Learn More</h2>

								          My path in life didn’t lead me straight to the farm.  I chose to take the long way around...  In high school, I had a great science teacher who kept me interested in botany, horticulture, and ecology.  Then in college I moved on to earn a Natural Resource Conservation Degree.  There I learned about soil science, botany, hydrology, ornithology, and the value of healthy ecosystems. I realized that nature really does best when it’s not polluted with chemical pesticides, fertilizers, and feed lot runoff.  I learned that there needs to be a balance in production and protection.

									<h3>Our Beautiful Farm in Redmond, OR</h3>
									<p>After living in Colorado for six years, then moving to Oregon almost 10 years ago, and a few odd jobs later, I have finally landed at my farm. My excitement for growing and eating fresh vegetables was renewed after moving to an area that has a more temperate climate than the mountains of Colorado.Since moving here I have been growing flowers, vegetables, and herbs organically.The first garden was a mere 4’x8’ raised bed and now I get to talk in acres. I learned a lot about the area by working at a garden center for six years.
