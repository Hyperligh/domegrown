								<h1><span>About Dome Grown Prodce</span></h1>
								

							<p>It all started way back when I was just a little girl, and I grew up on a farm in Upstate New York.  Some of my first childhood memories are of the garden and helping my dad in it.  Well, I don’t know how much help I really was…  I distinctly remember helping plant corn and beans, because the seeds were large and easy to handle.  I also helped eat a lot of vegetables right off the plants.  My mom would always find me out in the garden with a mouthful of cherry tomatoes.  I think that growing up on the farm instilled in me the value of fresh, safe food.

								          My path in life didn’t lead me straight to the farm.  I chose to take the long way around...  In high school, I had a great science teacher who kept me interested in botany, horticulture, and ecology.  Then in college I moved on to earn a Natural Resource Conservation Degree.  There I learned about soil science, botany, hydrology, ornithology, and the value of healthy ecosystems. I realized that nature really does best when it’s not polluted with chemical pesticides, fertilizers, and feed lot runoff.  I learned that there needs to be a balance in production and protection.
