It will start the first week of June and run through October.  The farm will be adding and utilizing existing greenhouses in hopes to extend the season on either side by a few weeks.</p><br />

									<h2>Dome Grown Produce CSA FAQ continued</h2>
									<h4>Are eggs included?</h4>
									<p>Eggs are an add on for $5/dozen.  Just let me know you would like eggs and we can add on the cost to your total or you can pay each time you get them.</p><br />
									<h4>Is the produce Organic?</h4> 
									<p>Our CSA farm supports biodynamic agriculture and environmentally sustainable methods.  We are not Certified Organic but we grow everything using the same standards.  The chickens also eat organically!  You can be assured that the only thing you find on the produce is a little dirt.  We do our best to control bugs before they become a problem with natural solutions.  Soapy water, vinegar, and hand picking are the top methods.  Our farm also grows flowers and plants that attract beneficial insects.</p><br /> 
									<h4>How do I pay for the share?</h4> 
									<p>Once you have decided which share is right for you, send the farm an email, download and print the brochure, or fill out the sign up form.  You will receive an email confirmation. Send checks to the farm by mail or pay in person with cash.  We are working on a paypal option for next year.  Shares can be paid in 2 payments with the first payment due by April 1st and final payment made at first pick-up.</p><br />
									<h4>How will I receive my share?</h4>  
									<p>There will be 2 pick-up days on the farm and one located at Central Oregon Locavore.  The farm pick-up is on Wednesday and Friday from 2pm-6pm.  I will update the Locavore pick-up as soon as its finalized.  The produce will be just harvested that morning and slightly rinsed.  I do recommend a thorough washing at home.  The produce will be in paper grocery bags and small items may be in a plastic bag.  Feel bring to bring your own basket or bag to transfer items or buy add on produce.  Some weeks there may be extra for purchase on pick up days.</p>
