								<li>To support a local farm, preserving our essential rural environment.</li>
								<li>To keep your hard earned money working in your community.</li>
							</ul><br />

										<h2>Weekly CSA Share Examples</h2>

									<p> Each week offers an exciting assortment of fresh produce. You'll get to experience first hand what 'eating in season' really means. Starting as early as May the first fresh greens and hardy cold crops start rolling in. Not far behind come the main summer season crops, including tomatoes, basil, beans, and beets. Later in the year come a lot of your root crops, winter squash, and potatoes.</p><br />
